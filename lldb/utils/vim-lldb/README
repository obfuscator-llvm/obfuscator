LLDB Vim Frontend
=================

Prerequisites
-------------

This plugin is known to work with the following flavours of Vim:

  * Linux (tested on Ubuntu 12.04/12.10):
      * vim/gvim (from vim-gnome package version 7.3)

  * Mac OS X (tested on Mountain Lion)
      * Vim command-line (7.3 from Xcode)
      * MacVim 7.3

To install the plugin, ensure you have
  * a working version of lldb on your path, or the environment variable LLDB
    pointing to the lldb binary you would like to use.
  * a python-enabled vim (check with ":python print 2")


Installation
------------

1) Install the Vim pathogen plugin (it keeps installed plugins organized):

    https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

  Or, for the impatient:

mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle; \
curl -Sso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim \
    https://raw.github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/master/autoload/pathogen.vim

2) Symlink (or copy) ~/.vim/bundle/vim-lldb to this directory:

ln -sf <lldb-dir>/utils/vim-lldb ~/.vim/bundle/vim-lldb

3) Update your help-tags. Start vim, do:

    :Helptags

4) Have fun!


Usage/Getting Help
------------------
All LLDB commands (with tab-completion) can be accessed in Vim's
command mode. Try it out by typing:

:L<tab>

There are several sources of help available:

:help lldb                  -- Documentation for this plugin
:Lhelp                      -- LLDB's built-in help system (i.e lldb 'help' command)
:Lscript help (lldb)        -- Complete LLDB Python API reference
