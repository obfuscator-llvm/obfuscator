    /// if it significantly slows down compilation or would prevent even basic
    /// debugging of the resulting binary.
    ///
    /// As an example, complex loop transformations such as versioning,

    /// increases code size by 5% for a particular benchmark, that benchmark
    /// should also be one which sees a 5% runtime improvement. If the compile
    /// time or code size penalties happen on average across a diverse range of
    /// LLVM users' benchmarks, then the improvements should as well.

    /// And no matter what, the compile time needs to not grow superlinearly
    /// with the size of input to LLVM so that users can control the runtime of
    /// the optimizer in this mode.

    /// code size or compile time for some benchmarks without corresponding
    /// improvements to execution time.
    ///
    /// Despite being willing to trade more compile time off to get improved
    /// execution time, this mode still tries to avoid superlinear growth in
    /// order to make even significantly slower compile times at least scale
    /// reasonably. This does not preclude very substantial constant factor
    /// costs though.
    O3,

    /// Similar to \c O2 but tries to optimize for small code size instead of
    /// fast execution without triggering significant incremental execution
    /// time slowdowns.

    /// execution time metrics swapped.

    /// produce substantially smaller executables that still run in
