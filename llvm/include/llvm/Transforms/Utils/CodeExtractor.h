  /// Utility class for extracting code into a new function.

  /// This utility provides a simple interface for extracting some sequence of
  /// code into its own function, replacing it with a call to that function. It
  /// also provides various methods to query about the nature and result of
  /// such a transformation.
  ///
  /// The rough algorithm used is:
  /// 1) Find both the inputs and outputs for the extracted region.
  /// 2) Pass the inputs as arguments, remapping them within the extracted
  ///    function to arguments.
  /// 3) Add allocas for any scalar outputs, adding all of the outputs' allocas
  ///    as arguments, and inserting stores to the arguments for any scalars.
